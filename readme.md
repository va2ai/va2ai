### 🚀 Professional Focus
*   **Operational Efficiency:** Drastically reduced manual analyst prep and review time for complex case work through grounded automation and validation layers.
*   **Audit-Ready Reliability:** Specialized in output consistency and traceability, achieving high-density citation coverage and minimal false-citation rates via custom evaluation frameworks.
*   **Performance Optimization:** Built production-grade workflows optimized for cost-efficiency and low-latency response times in interactive, multi-turn AI sessions.

### 🧠 Featured Projects

#### [**AI Agent Orchestration Platform**](https://github.com/va2ai/ai-agent-orchestration-platform)
*A "roundtable refinement" multi-agent system designed for high-accuracy reasoning.*
*   **The Impact:** Implemented parallel critic loops and convergence conditions that significantly accelerated refinement cycles compared to sequential chains.
*   **Key Features:** Structured outputs for iterative stability, run-metadata capture for debugging, and traceable history for audit logs.

#### [**Edge Deep Research & Validation API**](https://github.com/va2ai/edge-ai-search-validation-service)
*Edge-deployed research agent that performs multi-round search and returns citation-backed synthesis.*
*   **The Impact:** Developed robust source-quality scoring and conflict detection to mitigate hallucinations under strict edge latency constraints.
*   **Key Features:** Designed for low-latency validation and high-recall research against live web and internal data sources.

#### [**RAG Decision Analysis System**](https://github.com/va2ai/rag-decision-analysis-system)
*Extraction + hybrid retrieval pipeline for processing large corpuses of regulated legal decisions.*
*   **The Impact:** Achieved high retrieval recall by framing development around evaluation rigor—focusing on reproducible extraction and defensible output chains.
*   **Key Features:** Hybrid search optimization, entity extraction at scale, and similarity search for high-stakes decision matching.

#### [**DevPortAI RAG Fact-Check Monorepo**](https://github.com/va2ai/devportai-rag-fact-check)
*A reference architecture designed to stress-test and improve grounding reliability in RAG pipelines.*
*   **The Impact:** Successfully reduced ungrounded claims through multi-stage verification layers and improved overall retrieval correctness.

### 🛠 Core Competencies
*   **Agent Orchestration:** Multi-agent coordination, routing, memory management, and tool-use guardrails.
*   **Retrieval Engineering:** Advanced chunking strategies, embedding optimization, and hybrid search.
*   **Evals & Governance:** Building golden datasets, regression testing, and production telemetry.
*   **Data Intelligence:** Extracting structured, actionable insights from high-volume, "messy" legal and policy documentation.
