### 🧠 Featured Recent Projects

#### **Multi-Agent Ideation Pipeline**
*5-phase AI pipeline with specialized agents for market research, idea generation, validation, and scoring -- backed by a real-time SSE dashboard.*
*   **The Impact:** Orchestrates 5 specialized agents (Trend Hunter, Ideator, Validator, Scorer, Synthesizer) through a pub/sub event bus, producing ranked startup ideas from a single industry prompt.
*   **Key Features:** FastAPI server with SSE streaming, live agent status dashboard, Gemini Deep Research integration, LLM-powered narrative report generation, full observability metrics, and 200+ tests.

#### [**LLM Compaction Benchmark**](https://github.com/va2ai/llm-compaction-benchmark)
*Benchmarking conversation compaction quality across 6 Gemini models in a 36-combination matrix.*
*   **The Impact:** Discovered that smaller/faster models (gemini-2.5-flash-lite at 2s) outperform larger models (gemini-2.5-pro at 14s) for compaction, with the best combination achieving 132% quality retention.
*   **Key Features:** Fact recall, task continuation, and hallucination detection tests; interactive Chart.js dashboards; prompt engineering analysis showing quality improvement from 70% to 97%+.

#### [**AI Agent Orchestration Platform**](https://github.com/va2ai/ai-agent-orchestration-platform)
*A "roundtable refinement" multi-agent system designed for high-accuracy reasoning.*
*   **The Impact:** Implemented parallel critic loops and convergence conditions that significantly accelerated refinement cycles compared to sequential chains.
*   **Key Features:** Structured outputs for iterative stability, run-metadata capture for debugging, and traceable history for audit logs.

#### [**Edge Deep Research & Validation API**](https://github.com/va2ai/edge-ai-search-validation-service)
*Edge-deployed research agent that performs multi-round search and returns citation-backed synthesis.*
*   **The Impact:** Developed robust source-quality scoring and conflict detection to mitigate hallucinations under strict edge latency constraints.
*   **Key Features:** Designed for low-latency validation and high-recall research against live web and internal data sources.

#### [**RAG Decision Analysis System**](https://github.com/va2ai/rag-decision-analysis-system)
*Extraction + hybrid retrieval pipeline for processing large corpuses of regulated legal decisions.*
*   **The Impact:** Achieved high retrieval recall by framing development around evaluation rigor—focusing on reproducible extraction and defensible output chains.
*   **Key Features:** Hybrid search optimization, entity extraction at scale, and similarity search for high-stakes decision matching.

#### [**DevPortAI RAG Fact-Check Monorepo**](https://github.com/va2ai/devportai-rag-fact-check)
*A reference architecture designed to stress-test and improve grounding reliability in RAG pipelines.*
*   **The Impact:** Successfully reduced ungrounded claims through multi-stage verification layers and improved overall retrieval correctness.

### 🛠 Core Competencies
*   **Agent Orchestration:** Multi-agent coordination, routing, memory management, and tool-use guardrails.
*   **Retrieval Engineering:** Advanced chunking strategies, embedding optimization, and hybrid search.
*   **Evals & Governance:** Building golden datasets, regression testing, and production telemetry.
*   **Data Intelligence:** Extracting structured, actionable insights from high-volume, "messy" legal and policy documentation.
